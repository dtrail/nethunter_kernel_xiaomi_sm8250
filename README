Apollo N0tHunter Kernel [4.19][AOSP]
====================================

- For Kali NetHunter 2024.X
- Tested on LineageOS 21
- Based on N0Kernel by EmanuelCN
- Should boot on all Android 13+ AOSP-Roms (Android 15 is untested)
- Supports all officially supported external devices (USB WI-FI adapters, HID devices, BT devices, etc.)
- Additional support for RTL8188EUS-based chipsets (more devices coming up with later releases)
- Configured for better power-efficiency and battery life while retaining good performance
- MIUI currently not support, but possible: You need Emanuel's modified N0Kernel DTBO Image for MIUI, which you can get on his Telegram channel.


While keeping this repository mostly synced to N0Kernel, this kernel goes into a slightly different direction. 
Apart from being a Kali NetHunter kernel it focuses more on power-efficiency and battery backup while retaining overall good performance.
The Mi 10T Pro is powerful enough to have all these features and play next-gen mobile games, just in case you happen to run this on your daily driver or whatever.
But in a general use-case we focus primarily on getting more battery life. This comes into handy, for example, when powering an additional external OTG-connected device.

Feedback is always appreciated. You can get support on the XDA-Thread here: https://xdaforums.com/t/kernel-4-19-a13-apollo-kali-nethunter-n0thunter-kernel-12-13.4703051/

Happy hunting ;-)

============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
